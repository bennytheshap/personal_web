##Peer Reviewed
All acceptance rates listed are the most specific available for the conference year and submission category. In some cases, per-category data are not available and so the overall submission acceptance rate for the year is used. Any people whose names are followed by a superscripted s (<sup>s</sup>) were students at the time of co-authorship.
