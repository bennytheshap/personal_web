  I am an Assistant Professor in the [ATLAS Institute](http://atlas.colorado.edu), the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.colorado.edu/cs/), and (by courtesy) the [School of Education](http://www.colorado.edu/education/) and the [Department of Information Science](http://www.colorado.edu/cmci/academics/information-science) at the [University of Colorado *Boulder*](http://colorado.edu/).


  I received my PhD in the [Learning Sciences](http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/learning-sciences) from Northwestern University, and was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Games+Learning+Society](http://gameslearningsociety.org/) center at the [Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery](http://wid.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin, Madison](http://wisc.edu/). I was an Independent Studies major at the [University of California, San Diego](http://ucsd.edu/), where I was a member of the [Distributed Cognition and Human-Computer Interaction](http://hci.ucsd.edu/) lab.

  The [Laboratory for Playful Computation](http://atlas.colorado.edu/lpc) creates  [playful](http://codingconduct.cc/Paideia-as-Paidia) and [constructionist](http://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/readings/Papert-Big-Idea.pdf) learning environments.


  We study how designing and building computational systems (e.g., computer music systems) can empower young people to learn through  pursuing  personal interests. To do so, we create new technologies for learning and investigate how people, including students and teachers, use them to learn together.
