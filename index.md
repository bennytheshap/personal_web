  I am an Assistant Professor in the [ATLAS Institute](http://atlas.colorado.edu), the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.colorado.edu/cs/), and (by courtesy) the [School of Education](http://www.colorado.edu/education/) at the University of Colorado *Boulder*.


  I received my PhD from Northwestern University in Learning Sciences, and was a postdoctoral fellow in the Games+Learning+Society group at the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I studied computer science and cognitive science at the University of California, San Diego, where I was a member of the Distributed Cognition and Human-Computer Interaction Lab. Prior to arriving at CU, I was a professor at Tufts University.

  The [Laboratory for Playful Computation](http://atlas.colorado.edu/lpc) creates  [playful](http://codingconduct.cc/Paideia-as-Paidia) and [constructionist](http://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/readings/Papert-Big-Idea.pdf) learning environments.


  We study how designing and building computational systems (e.g., computer music systems) can empower young people to learn through  pursuing  personal interests. To do so, we create new technologies for learning and investigate how people, including students and teachers, use them to learn together.
